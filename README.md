# Deep-Learning-Projects

## (1) Handwritten Digit Recognition

### Overview

This repository contains a Python project for recognizing handwritten digits using machine learning. The primary objective is to develop a model capable of accurately classifying digits from images.

### Libraries Used

- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning algorithms and tools.
- **NumPy and Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: For building and training neural networks.

### Features
- Import necessary libraries and mnist dataset from it.
- Split the dataset into train and test.
- Normalize the splited datasets.
- Build the *CNN model* and compile it.
- Train the model to learn the parameters.
- Build the predictive system that take the input as image and give the output as label.
